**Mike Taylor <dino@miketaylor.org.uk>**

This respository contains my work on an in-progress paper that will
formally describe NHMUK 5937, a Tendaguru brachiosaurid sauropod
dinosaur known as "The Archbishop".

I've been intending to do this work for more than thirteen years now -- see for example [my 2005 SVPCA talk _Sweet Seventy-Five and Never Been Kissed_](http://www.miketaylor.org.uk/dino/pubs/svpca2005/abstract.html) -- but I keep getting distracted from this, my main project, by side-projects that I think will be quick and easy but which become big projects themselves.

In the past, I've written my academic works in LibreOffice, submitted them for peer-review, and only allowed the world to see them after they've been revised, accepted and published. More recently, I've been using [preprints](https://peerj.com/preprints/3415/) to make my submitted drafts public before peer review. But there's no compelling reason not to go more open than that, so I'll be writing this paper out in the open, in a GitHub repository than anyone can see. That also means anyone can [file issues](https://github.com/MikeTaylor/palaeo-archbishop/issues), and anyone can submit [pull-requests](https://github.com/MikeTaylor/palaeo-archbishop/pulls).

I'll be writing this paper in [GitHub Flavoured Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) so that it displays correctly right in the browser, and so that patches can be supported. That will make tables a bit more cumbersome, but it should be manageable.
