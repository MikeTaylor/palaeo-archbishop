I want to make a composite of the three pieces of scapula, keeping the
pieces in scale. I am working from:

DSCN2958.JPG -- all three pieces, to scale of course
DSCN2960.JPG -- middle portion
DSCN2961.JPG -- distal portion (obscured by scalebar)
DSCN2962.JPG -- distal portion

Since I stupidly did not get a good photo of the proximal postion, the goal is to make a composite of:
* middle portion from DSCN2960.JPG
* distal portion from DSCN2962.JPG
* proximal portion from the top left part of DSCN2958.JPG

To scale the bones from the different images, I need measurements:
* middle portion greatest diameter:
	DSCN2958.JPG -- 1561 pixels
	DSCN2960.JPG -- 2136 pixels
	=> scaled up by 2136/1561 = 1.368
* distal portion greatest diameter:
	DSCN2958.JPG -- 885 pixels
	DSCN2962.JPG -- 1857 pixels
	=> scaled up by 1857/885 = 2.098

So to bring all the pieces together at the resolution of the middle portion I need:
* DSCN2960.JPG at its natural resolution
* top left part of DSCN2958.JPG scaled by 1.368
* DSCN2962.JPG scaled by 1.368/2.098 = 0.652
