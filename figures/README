Line-drawing black at 100% opacity
using brush "2. Hardness 075"
size 1/1000 of page width
(So e.g. Cervical V composite is 4222 pixels wide => 4 px brush)

Line-drawing shading black at 20% opacity
using brush "2. Hardness 050"
Size 1/16 of page width
(So e.g. Cervical V composite is 4222 pixels wide => 264 px brush)

Lines connecting anatomical captions:
Layer group with black lines and white lines, all at 33% opacity
using brush "2. Hardness 075"
size 1/600 of page width
(So e.g. Cervical V composite is 4222 pixels wide => 7 px brush)
White lines shifted down and right by 1/1400 page width
(So e.g. Cervical V composite is 4222 pixels wide => 3 pixel shift)
	
Line-drawing texture photos desaturated at 20% opacity

Line-drawing silhouettes black at 20% opacity

Part captions ("A", "B", etc.) black in Gill Sans
Font size 1/28 of page width
(So e.g. Cervical V composite is 4222 pixels wide => 151 point font)
Top of rendered font vertically aligned with image part
Horizonally positioned to left of image part

	On horizontal spacing: as GUIDELINE, align so that there is
	just room for an "M" to follow. (Do this by setting the part
	caption to its desired value followed by "M", positioning it,
	and deleting the "M" suffix.)

Anatomical captions ("prezygapophysis", etc.) black in Gill Sans
Font size 1/47 of page width
(So e.g. Cervical V composite is 4222 pixels wide => 90 point font)

Scale bars 20 cm, with thickness 1/16 of length
