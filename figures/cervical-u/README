Width of composite image is 3323 pixels, so drawing sizes are:
Line-drawing brush: 3323/1000 = 3.3 px
White lines shift: 3323/1400 = 3 pixel shift
Shading brush: 3323/16 = 208 px
Lines connecting anatomical captions: 3323/600 = 6 px
Part-caption font: 3323/28 = 119 point
Anatomical-caption font: 3323/47 = 71 point

	Greatest length in lateral view measures 2158 pixels.
	This is 75 cm in real life, so we have 2158/75 = 28.77 pixels per cm.
	So a 20 cm scale bar is 28.77*20 = 575 pixels
	=> depth of scale bar = 575/16 = 36 pixels
