# Migeod's quarry maps

It turns out that there are two separate (though similar) drawings of the quarry. One of them appears as Figure 1 in Migeod's (1931) account, and is reproduced in some of the other publications of that year. The other is unpublished, so far as I can tell.


## Published map

I have two decent scans of this:

* [`rescan-p088.png`](rescan-p088.png) -- My own scan (I think): my records are not perfect.
* [`fig. 1.PNG`](fig.%201.PNG) -- Mo Hassan's scan. It is better quality than mine on the whole, but with unwelcome blurring in the lower region.

		
## Unpublished map

The other drawing is as far as I know unpublished, and I have copies only thanks to Susie Maidment. Unfortunately I do not have a perfect copy, only these two files:

* [`Migeod M23 site map.jpg`](Migeod%20M23%20site%20map.jpg) -- very good quality scan of most of map, but with some parts missing.
* [`M23 Overview 1.jpg`](M23%20Overview%201.jpg) -- a complete but much lower-quality scan.

I will combine these two by using the low-quality scan as a guide to redraw the missing parts into the high-quality scan.


## Comparison

It's not clear why there are two of these. We might guess that the unpublished version was redrawn for publication, but the published map is not noticeably better than the unpublished, and is in some ways inferior. In any case, Migeod's original field drawings (from his field notes) are very sketchy: both the unpublished published and unpublished versions are much better than those sketches.
