Subject: Using your Giraffatitan

Hi, Scott, hope all is well.

It's been a loooong time coming, but I really am working on the Archbishop description now: see the ongoing work at https://github.com/MikeTaylor/palaeo-archbishop/ if interested.

As part of the paper, I want to include an inventory of material in the form of a skeletal schematic: white for the bones we actually have prepped and available for study, pale grey for those that may still be in jackets awaiting prep, and dark grey for those mentioned by Migeod or Parrington back in 1931 but since lost or destroyed.

If you are amenable, I would love to use your Giraffatitan reconstruction at https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51bf1cd3e4b0a897bf54112b/1390494117193-0FTOP9PW54IJLSE3UNGB/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kDHPSfPanjkWqhH6pl6g5ph7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UXcz6T1C1K_MgYDPUzqybLksslZ_8HdVAwYh7yAs0h_EVgI4FK6Hv-LPRlRdIDmx2w/Giraffatitan.jpg?format=1500w as the basis for this. (Traditionally, the Archbishop has been considered a specimen of the African brachiosaur species, but in phylogenetic analysis it's coming out as a basal somphospondylian; but I think in general proportions, Giraffatitan is still a decent match.)

You know my circumstances and tendencies: I am 100% unfunded, and will place this paper in a CC By journal (most likely PeerJ if they will accept an oversized manuscript). That means I am not offering money, which I feel bad about. So please, if you would prefer that I not use your work on that basis, feel absolutely free to say so!

But if you're happy for me to proceed, I would appreciate if you could sent me the full resolution version.

Many thanks â€” I'm sorry to keep exploiting you like this but, hey *shrug* if you're gonna lead the world in scientifically rigorous sauropod reconstructions, what do you expect? :-)

-- Mike.

Hi Mike,

You are welcome to use my skeletal, which I've attached below. PeerJ will probably accept your oversized manuscript, but they will also charge you extra for it (the Lori paper had quite a bit of extra publishing cost tacked on to it due to length, and I'm assuming you are talking about a longer paper). And because of how the system is set up the exact cost is generally not known up until your paper is otherwise ready to be published, at which point you are sort of over a barrel.

Anyhow, I am glad to hear you are getting the Archbishop manuscript ready to publish, cheers!

-Scott
