I have no measurements for cervical V. As a stop-gap measure until I
am able to visit the materal again and measure properly, I created
lateral-with-scaling-from-DSCN7618.xcf which superimposes onto the
lateral view image a photo of the posterior portion of the vertebra
that happened to have a tape measure alongside it. I extended the tape
measure (scaling the copied part to 95% to account for perspective
distortion) and used it to measure the whole centrum.

Using this approximate and error-prone method, I find that when the
ventral lip of the posterior margin of the centrum is about level with
the 18 cm mark on the tape, the anterior part of the condyle is about
where the 46 cm mark would be, having been extended by 30 cm. This
gives a rough total length of 46-18+30 = 58 cm, which is longer than I
remember but I gotta go where the measurements take me.

(But surely the fact that I had a tape measure alongside the vertebra
suggests I must have actually measured it? So where are the
measurements?)
