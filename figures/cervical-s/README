Width of composite image is 3554 pixels, so drawing sizes are:
Line-drawing brush: 3554/1000  = 3.5 px
Shading brush: 3554/16 = 222 px
Lines connecting anatomical captions: 3554/600 = 6 px
Part-caption font: 3554/28 = 127 point
Anatomical-caption font: 3554/47 = 76 point

	Greatest length in lateral view measures 2057 pixels.
	This is 75 cm in real life, so we have 2057/75 = 27.43 pixels per cm.
	So a 20 cm scale bar is 27.43*20 = 549 pixels
	=> depth of scale bar = 549/16 = 34 pixels
