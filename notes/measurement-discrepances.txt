Migeod's measurements make it seem unlikely that all the material really belongs to a single animal — for example, the humeri seem much too short — but the articulation of the vertebrae makes their associated pretty rock solid.  And that is plenty enough to make this an awesome specimen.

Curtice et al. (1996: table 2) give measurements for several brachiosaurid scapulocoracoids. The longest scapulocoracoid lengths are 2500 mm for BYU 9462 (“Ultrasaurus“) and 2430 mm for HMN Sa 9 (Giraffatitan).

I measure Migeod’s quarry-map scapulocoracoid at 334 pixels; and his 10-foot scalebar at 290 pixels, or 29 pixels per foot. If correct, it would make the element 11.5 feet long (as you said), which is 3.5 m. That’s fully 40% longer than the current record, which — how shall I put it? — strains credulity somewhat.
