PCRPRUNE
    Improve consensus by Iterative PCR (Pol & Escapa, 2009). 
         N/L\U      improve consensus of tree(s) N, excluding taxa 
                    in list L, but never removing taxa in U. 
    List of trees may be preceded by:  
          =C    maximum number of taxa to cut at a time (default=all) 
          :K    assign a cost of K (0-100) to taxon remotion (higher 
                K's require more nodes gained for a taxon removal to 
                be accepted as "improvement"; default=0.5) 
          >N    only show prunings which improve N nodes or more 
                (for strict consensus only, not for majority) 
          [N]   improve only node N of consensus (for strict  
                consensus only, not for majority) 
          &     for pruning strict consensus only, when finding that 
                a triplet is present in all trees, try to combine  
                with previously checked triplets to infer resolution 
                of triplets not yet checked.  Faster for larger numbers  
                of trees, differing in fewer taxa 
    and if followed by ">N", all the prunes are added to taxon-group 
    number N (note that this option requires an explicit tree list, for 
    otherwise it would be interpreted as the option to only show prunings 
    which improve N nodes; see above). 
    The consensus types can be indicated in parentheses, also before 
    tree-list: 
      (majority F)  heuristically try to improve majority rule tree,  
                    considering that triplets occurring in frequency F  
                    or higher are "compatible" (50<=F<=100, default=50) 
       (nelsen)     improve strict consensus tree (=default)
