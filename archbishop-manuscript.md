## Description

### Catalogue of material

Since the serial positions of vertebrae are not possible to determine with confidence, the various elements have been assigned letters. The letters were assigned piecemeal some time ago, and are no particular order. They convey no implication of serial position. Available material of the Archbishop includes:

Name | Element | Description
:--- | :------ | :----------
W | ?cervical vertebra | Unprepossessing lump of bone, difficult to interpret
V | cervical vertebra | Small, anterior cervical vertebra, still half-jacketed. Poorly presered and very fragile. 
U | cervical vertebra | Large, well preserved cervical vertebra, half-jacketed with the right side and anterior/posterior extremities exposed.
P | cervical vertebra | Large cervical vertebra, well preserved in places, but obscured by poorly executed restoration.
S | cervical centrum | Large cervical vertebral centrum, almost all of the neural arch and ann processes missing.
T | cervical centrum | Large cervical vertebral centrum, almost all of the neural arch and ann processes missing.
X1 | cervical rib | Proximal portion of left cervical rib, reasonably well preserved.
X2 | cervical rib | Proximal portion of right cervical rib, poorly preserved.
X3 | cervical rib | Proximal portion of right cervical rib, poorly preserved.
X | cervical rib framents | Portions of cervical rib shafts, impossible to associate convincingly with X1-X3.
A/B | dorsal vertebrae | Conjoined consecutive pair of well-preserved essentially complete dorsal vertebrae.
C | dorsal neural spine | Isolated neural arch and spine from a dorsal vertebra.
Q/R | dorsal centra | Conjoined consecutive pair of dorsal vertebral centra.
Z | semi-prepared jacket | Difficult-to-interpret set of bones, almost certainly vertebral processes.
N | ?scapula | Two pieces of uninformative flat bone.
O | ?coracoid | Flat, subcircular piece of bone.
M | ?pubis | Portion of a bone with a complex shape.
L | long-bone fragment | Portion from the shaft of a limb bone, both ends missing.

In addition, there are a dozen or so as-yet unopened jackets from the Migeod expedition. However, these do not look promising in their ability to deliver further informative material. They are too small to contain complete vertebrae or even substantial partial vertebral material, and since there is no reason to expect that they contain cranial material, it is likely that the contents are mostly limb- and girld-bone fragments and indeterminate scraps. However, the chance remains that some diagnost material is contained, and the jackets should be prepped as circumstances allow.
