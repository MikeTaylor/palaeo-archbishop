## Introduction

The German East Africa expeditions of the Humboldt Museum für Naturkunde in the period before the First World War were among the most ambitious ever undertaken (Maier 2003), and yielded many superb dinosaur skeletons including the type specimens of new sauropod, theropod and ornithischian dinosaurs. After the war, the subsequent expeditions of the British Museum (Natural History) were much humbler affairs, and their results were correspondingly unimpressive. The best specimen -- a large and fairly complete sauropod skeleton -- was excavated and returned to London, but was then largely ignored for the next 75 years. In this paper, I describe this overlooked specimen, assess its affinities, and discuss its implications for sauropod systematics and palaeoecology.

## Historical background



### The German East Africa Expeditions

Between the years of 1907 and 1913, the Humboldt Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, Germany, sent a series of palaeontological expeditions to Tendaguru in what was then German East Africa (Maier2003).  These expeditions, led by Werner Janensch, excavated more than 185 tonnes of fossils, mostly dinosaurs.  When prepared, these fossils proved to include spectacularly complete specimens representing several dinosaurian clades: the ceratosaurian theropod _Elaphrosaurus bambergi_ Janensch, 1920, the ornithopod _Dysalotosaurus lettowvorbecki_ Virchow, 1919, the spiked stegosaur _Kentrosaurus aethiopicus_ Hennig, 1915, and several different sauropods: two species of _Dicraeosaurus_ (_D_. _hansemanni_ and _D_. _sattleri_ Janensch 1914), representing the then new family Dicraeosauridae; “_Gigantosaurus_” _africanus_ Fraas, 1908, whose complex affinities are outlined below; and the giant brachiosaurid “_Brachiosaurus_” _brancai_ Janensch, 1914, the mounted skeleton of which is the centerpiece of the exhibition of the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin. (Further species have been named from the Tendaguru formation, but these are based on fragmentary remains.)

The nomenclatural history of the well-represented species has in some cases been complex. Because of its effect on the apparent diversity of dinosaurs in the Tendaguru Formation, this history warrants some explanation.

_Dysalotosaurus_ was synonymised with _Dryosaurus_ Marsh, 1894, by Galton (1977), yielding the combination _Dryosaurus lettowvorbecki_. This has been followed by most authors, although it was recently disputed by Witzmann et al (2008) and awaits further exploration.

The year after _Kentrosaurus_ was named, its author, noting that the name was similar to and shared its etymology with the ceratopsian dinosaur _Centrosaurus_ Lambe, 1904, proposed the replacement name _Kentrurosaurus_ Hennig, 1916; and Nopcsa (1916) independently proposed the replacement name _Doryphorosaurus_ for the same reason. However, since _Centrosaurus_ is pronounced with a soft “C” and _Kentrosaurus_ with a hard “K”, the two are not homonyms, and the original name remains valid, with _Kentrurosaurus_ and _Doryphorosaurus_ being junior objective synonyms.

As recounted in detail by Taylor (2009), Janensch's referral of the species “_Brachiosaurus_” _brancai_ to the North American genus _Brachiosaurus_ Riggs, 1903 was made without having seen material of type species _Brachiosaurus altithorax_ Riggs, 1903, and was based primarily on features which we can now recognise as symplesiomorphies. The referral was questioned by Lull (1911), but generally accepted until Paul (1988) noticed proportional differences between the species while executing a skeletal reconstruction, and accordingly proposed subgeneric separation, with the African species becoming _Brachiosaurus_ (_Giraffatitan_) _brancai_. Olshevsky (1991) proposed that the subgenus _Giraffatitan_ be raised to generic rank, but the name was not used in the literature, “_Brachiosaurus_” _brancai_ being retained, until Taylor (2009) demonstrated, based on 26 features that differ from _Brachiosaurus altithorax_, that _Giraffatitan brancai_ is indeed generically distinct, and this usage is now generally followed.

The name “_Gigantosaurus_” has the most complex history of all. Fraas chose this name in full knowledge that it had already been used for the poorly represented English genus _Gigantosaurus_ Seeley, 1869, but wrongly believing that the name was available as Seeley had not described or figured the material that his own genus was founded on. He named the type species _G_. _africanus_ and referred a second species, _G_. _robustus_. Recognising Fraas's error in using a preoccupied name, Sternfeld (1911) renamed the German genus _Tornieria_, the two species becoming _T_. _africana_ and _T_. _robusta_. Janensch (1922), however, continued to use the older name “_Gigantosaurus_”, but observed in a footnote that differences such as possession of bifid neural spines in “_G_”. _africanus_ and single spines in “_G_”. _robustus_ required generic separation. Believing the type species “_G_”. _africanus_ to belong to the North American genus _Barosaurus_ Marsh, 1890, Janensch referred to the two species as _Barosaurus africanus_ and _Gigantosaurus robustus_. The latter name would have been invalid even if the genus _Gigantosaurus_ had not been preoccipied, since its type species had been removed making _Gigantosarus_ a junior subjective synonym of _Barosaurus_; however, Janensch did not refer the remaining species _robustus_ to a new genus as he should have done. This was eventually done by Wild (1991), who placed the species in the new genus _Janenschia_ as _J_. _robusta_, and assigned it to Titanosauria. Bonaparte et al (2000), however, noted that the axial material assigned to _Janenschia_ was not convincingly associated with the appendicular type material, and removed this material to another new genus, _Tendaguria_. They considered _Janenschia_ to be a camarasaurid and _Tendaguria_ to belong to its own monogeneric family due to the very unusual morphology of the dorsal vertebra on which is was based. Janensch's referral of the _Tornieria africana_ material to _Barosaurus_ was mostly followed, but McIntosh (2005) questioned this, considering it more similar to _Diplodocus_ and not convincingly congeneric with either. Remes (2006) restudied this material and concluded that it represents a distinct genus for which he resurrecting the available name _Tornieria_, which now contains only the single species _T_. _africana_. Finally, Remes (2007) noted that two cervical vertebrae that had been referred to this species were distinct, and referred them to the new genus _Australodocus_. In conclusion, the two species of “_Gigantosaurus_” are now considered to belong to four distinct monospecific genera: _Tornieria_, _Janenschia_, _Tendaguria_ and _Australodocus_.



### The British Museum East Africa Expedition

German operations in East Africa were interrupted by the Great War (1914-1918), during which the territory of German East Africa changed hands and became the British protectorate of Tanganyika. Aware of the impressive results of the German expeditions, the British Museum (Natural History) began in 1920 to plan expeditions of their own, hoping to obtain display-quality specimens comparable to those that were starting to emerge from Berlin. After a series of delays, the expeditions finally commenced in 1924, under the leadership of William Cutler assisted by Louis Leakey. Cutler died in the field in 1925, having obtained only fragmentary material, and was replaced by Frederick W. H. Migeod in late 1925 and through 1926. However, Migeod's work was impeded by his lack of palaeontological experience, as he was an explorer rather than a scientist. For this reason he was himself replaced by John Parkinson for the 1927 and 1928 field seasons. For reasons that are unclear, Parkinson's contract was not renewed in 1929, and Migeod returned, to be joined in 1930 by a new assistant, Francis R. “Rex” Parrington. By this stage, the BMNH had been excavating in Tendaguru for six years with little to show for it: there were plenty of isolated bones, but no skeleton complete enough to compare with the spectacular German material.

The 1930 field season, however, excavated quarry M 23, and so yielded the specimen that the BMNH had been awaiting. Although Migeod was 58 by this time, he supervised the excavation of a large, fairly complete and partially articulated sauropod skeleton, since catalogued as BMNH R5937, now NHMUK PV R5937. Although this material seemed to meet the BMNH's requirement for a display-quality specimen, it remained largely unprepared and was described only in an informal account of the 1930 field season (Migeod 1931a), a paper written without having seen any of the material prepared, and which is figured only with field photographs and a quarry map. Several subsequent popular accounts (Migeod 1931b, Migeod 1931c, Parrington 1931) added little information.

XXX ### “Funds are lacking” at end of Discovery article.

Despite its completeness and the good preservation of some of the material, Migeod's specimen has been consistently neglected in the intervening decades: much of what was collected has been lost, some of what remains has yet to be prepared, and the prepared material has never been properly studied. When in the early 1960, John S. McIntosh expressed an interest in studying the material, he was discouraged a letter sent by W. E. Swinton which read (in part): “I feel rather sad at your quest for I knew Migeod very well and had much sympathy with him but alas, I knew the material he collected even better [...] The few good bones he collected would not constitute a single limb and but a few feet of backbone. Indeed, much of East Africa was enclosed in plaster with the mistaken impression that bone was contained within. You will not, therefore, see any monographs on the specimen and you can dismiss his particular dinosaur from your mind” (unpublished letter). Swinton's dismissal is puzzling, contradicting Migeod's own account of the material and, as will become clear, greatly underestimating its value.

What few references there have been to NHMUK PV R5937 in the literature have often used incorrect specimen numbers and mischaracterised the material – for example, Paul (1988) and Glut (1997) refer to specimen “BMNH M 23”, using the quarry number as a specimen number. 




## Contemporary accounts

XXX Migeod papers: material found, quarry map, interpretations

Migeod's (1931a) reporting is in places haphazard: only a random smattering of measurements are given, for example; and on page 92 he gives the length of the "shoulder vertebra" (see below) as 24 inches, then four sentences later as 23 inches.

Tree roots had damaged the skeleton mostly in the sacral region (Migeod 1931a:88). A damp layer ran through the skeleton so that "while the highest and the lowest bones were hard, the intermediate section was powdery" (Migeod 1931a:88), and corroding impregnation of iron had done considerable damage.

Migeod notes that although no skull bones were recovered (nor the four or five most anteror cervicals), "a large tooth was, however found, measuring 6½ inches in length with a maximum circumference of 5¾ inches, which would indicate that the head was large" (Migeod 1931a:90), but since the tooth was pointed is must have belonged to a scavenging theropod rather than to Migeod's sauropod -- a possibility that Migeod allowed -- and so tells us nothing about the animal in question.

"The [neck] vertebrae found give a 20-foot length [...] The length of the back including the sacral region was about 15 feet. The eight or nine caudal vertebrae cover about 6 feet" (Migeod 1931a:90). This gives the total preserved length of the skeleton as 41 feet (12.5 m).

Migeod's numbering of the vertebrae of this specimen was unusual. Rather than number the cervicals starting at C1 for the atlas and increasing backwards, he designated a single "shoulder vertebra", and counted both cervical vertebra forward from this zero-point, and dorsal vertebrae backwards. The sequence of vertebrae from posterior neck backwards, then, using Migeod's numbering, was ... C3, C2, C1, 0, D1, D2, D3.

When referring to cervical vertebra numbers as assigned by Migeod, I use the form mC<i>n</i> to mean "the vertebra designated C<i>n</i> by Migeod"; and when referring to dorsal vertebra numbers as assigned by Migeod, I use the form mD<i>n</i> to mean "the vertebra designated D<i>n</i> by Migeod".

The identity of the "shoulder vertebra" can be established, though with some uncertainty, by its dimensions and those of the vertebrae either side. Migeod (1931a:91-92) says mC1 is 33 inches long, the shoulder vertebra 23 inches, and D1 11 inches long; and that mC3 is the longest vertebra at 41 inches (104 cm). This makes the shoulder vertebra 56% the length of of the longest cervical. In the _Giraffatitan brancai_ paralectotype MB.R.2181 (formerly HMN SII), the longest vertebrae are C10 and C11, at 87 cm (excluding the condyle). 56% of this is 49 cm, which is a good match for the length of D1 at 46 cm -- at least, a much better match than for C13 (67 cm) or D2 (36 cm). On this basis, the "shoulder vertebra" of Migeod's usage is most likely D1, and the ratios of vertebral length of the two vertebrae either side of (143% for C13, 48% for mD1) are comparable with the corresponding ratios in MB.R.2181 (146% for C13, 78% for D2). The reduction in length from D1 to D2 in the Archbishop is more abrupt than in MB.R.2181, but these numbers must be treated with caution: while Janensch carefully gave these lengths as those of the vertebra centra not including the condyles, Migeod referred only to "length", not specifying whether it included the overhanging prezygapophyses, the condyles, or neither.

Nevertheless, I will proceed on the assumption that Migeod's "shoulder vertebra" is D1. Assuming, then, that the Archbishop had thirteen cervicals, then mC<i>n</i> is C(14-_n_), so mC3 is C11; and mD<i>n</i> is D(_n_+1), so mD5 is D6. XXX check whether to refer to a different dorsal for this.


XXX Parrington papers

XXX Migeod speaks of the dorsal vertebrae having "wings". FMNH P25107's presacral P7 shows an "apron" similar to that of SII.D?7 -- a wide, contiguous set of horizontal laminae joining prezygs to diapophyses and postzygs.  This morphology is unusual, and may be what Migeod refers to as "wings".

## Description



### Catalogue of material

Many of the elements that were prepared long age have either Migeod's quarry number M 23 painted directly on them, or the specimen number R 5937 written on a small, round yellow label firmly fixed to the bone, so their inclusion in the hypodigm is easy to establish.

Since the serial positions of vertebrae are not possible to determine with confidence, the various elements have been assigned letters. The letters were assigned piecemeal some time ago, and are no particular order. They convey no implication of serial position. Available material of the Archbishop includes:

Name | Element | Description
:--- | :------ | :----------
V | cervical vertebra | Small, anterior cervical vertebra, still half-jacketed. Poorly presered and very fragile. 
S | cervical centrum | Large cervical vertebral centrum, almost all of the neural arch and ann processes missing.
T | cervical centrum | Large cervical vertebral centrum, almost all of the neural arch and ann processes missing.
U | cervical vertebra | Large, well preserved cervical vertebra, half-jacketed with the right side and anterior/posterior extremities exposed.
P | cervical vertebra | Large cervical vertebra, well preserved in places, but obscured by poorly executed restoration.
W | ?cervical vertebra | Unprepossessing lump of bone from posterior cervical, difficult to interpret
X | cervical rib framents | Portions of cervical rib shafts, impossible to associate convincingly with X1-X3.
X1 | cervical rib | Proximal portion of left cervical rib, reasonably well preserved.
X2 | cervical rib | Proximal portion of right cervical rib, poorly preserved.
X3 | cervical rib | Proximal portion of right cervical rib, poorly preserved.
C | dorsal neural spine | Isolated neural arch and spine from a dorsal vertebra.
Q/R | dorsal centra | Conjoined consecutive pair of dorsal vertebral centra.
A/B | dorsal vertebrae | Conjoined consecutive pair of well-preserved essentially complete dorsal vertebrae.
Z | semi-prepared jacket | Difficult-to-interpret set of bones, almost certainly vertebral processes.
N | scapula | Three pieces of mostly uninformative flat bone.
L | humerus fragment | Portion from the shaft of a limb bone, both ends missing.
M | ?pubis | Portion of a bone with a complex shape.

In addition, there are a dozen or so as-yet unopened jackets from the Migeod expedition (see below).

### Scapula N

![Composite view of Scapula S](figures/export/scapula-n-composite.jpeg)

> **Figure N.** NHMUK PV R5937, "The Archbishop", Three parts of a scapula: from left to right, parts N1, N2 and N3, described respectively on their field jackets as proximal, [("scapula and coracoid")](OLD/photos/2005-09-05/jackets/dscn1662.jpg) and distal. Note that the arrangement and orientation of the parts here is purely speculative.

XXX The only identifiable features are the acromion process and fossa on the dorsal margin of part N2. If this part of the bone is correctly identified, then the absence of a discernable acromion ridge suggests that the medial side of the scapular has been prepared, in which case this would be a right scapula.

### humerus fragment L

![Composite view of humerus fragment L](figures/export/long-bone-l-composite.jpeg)

> **Figure L.** NHMUK PV R5937, "The Archbishop", long-bone fragment L, probably a portion from the distal end of a right humerus. Top row: proximal view (anterior to top); Middle row, left to right: anterior, medial, posterior and lateral views; Bottom row: distal view (posterior to top)

Measurements: 46 cm along the longer side, 35cm along the shorter side, 30cm wide and 12cm thick at the larger end (the 12cm being at the narrow midpoint), 24x16cm at narrow end (the 24cm being exaggerated by the diagonal breakage. I estimate 22cm orthogonally.) There is no sign of a marrow cavity.

This fragment is all that remains of a long bones, and is not particularly informative. Its likely identification as a part of the distal end of the right humerus is based on the presence of the anconial fossa at the broader end, interpreted as distal. This also gives us the orientation of the bone, with face showing this fossa being posterior. The irregular shape of the distal cross section suggests that this is a right humerus because in _Giraffatitan_ the medial aspect is more rounded and the lateral more irregularly shaped: compare with Janensch (1961: Beilage A: figure 1e).

### Unprepared jackets

![Unprepared jackets](figures/export/all-unprepped-jackets--dscn1643-dscn1647.jpg)

> **Figure J.** NHMUK PV R5937, "The Archbishop", jackets containing as-yet unprepared material as of 5 September 2005. See text for catalogue.

* Shelf 1
  * **A.** "M 23 / Scapula 8 / Distal end / 3.7.30". Subsequently prepared as [scapula N](#scapula-n), part N3].
  * **B.** "M 23 / Scapula / and Coracoid (fused) / 3.7.30". Subsequently prepared as [scapula N](#scapula-n), part N2. Label photographed in [dscn1662.jpg](OLD/photos/2005-09-05/jackets/dscn1662.jpg).
  * **C.** "M 23 / Scapula / Proximal end / 3.7.30". Subsequently prepared as [scapula N](#scapula-n), part N1.
* Shelf 2
  * **D.** "M 23 / Uncertain / Process / between Verts: / (Dorsal) 9 + 10 / 24/6/30"
  * **E.** "M 23 / Cervical Vert. No. 3 / Block D / Under A / 26/7/30"
  * **F.** "M 23 / Ilium part 2 / 6/30"
  * **G.** "M 23 / Dorsal Vert 3 / Lower i.e. / Right wing / 7/30"
  * **H.** "M 23 / Dorsal Vert No. 3 / Neural spine / upper / (i.e. left side) / 23.7.30"
* Shelf 3
  * **I.** Three labels:
    * "Cerv 3 / Block B / Distal + lower end"
    * "Cervical / vert. No. 3 / Block B / 26/7/30"
    * "Cerv. V: 3 / Junction with / Block E by / 'brodie'"
  * **J.** "M 23 / Cervical Vert 3 / Block E / 26.7.30". Subsequently prepared as [Cervical W](#cervical-w).
* Shelf 4
  * **K.** "Sacral / part / B". Apparently [misidentified](OLD/photos/2005-09-05/jackets/dscn1681.jpg) or mislabelled, and subsequently prepared as [Pubis M](#pubis-m).
  * **L.** (no label)
  * **M.** "M 23 / Cervical No. 9 / + frag of / No. 10 / 6/30"
  * **N.** (no label)
* Shelf 5
  * **O.** "M 23 / Scapula 10 / Distal end / 9.7.30"
  * **P.** "M 23 / next / (sacral) / Vert 10 / Ventral edge / 6/30"
  * **Q.** "M 23 / Dorsal Vert 6 / 3.7.30"
* Shelf 6
  * **R.** "M 23 Cervical" (written on plaster; label is torn). Subsequently prepared as [Cervical V](#cervical-v).
  * **S.** (two labels, both illegible] "D5" scratched into plaster)

XXX Misidentification of Pubis M as a sacral vertebra casts some doubt on the labelling of the other jackets.

In summary, the remaining jackets should contain
"cervical vertebra 9 and a fragment of 10" (i.e. probably C5 and a fragment of C4),
several portions of "cervical vertebra 3" (i.e. probably C11),
parts of dorsal vertebra 3 including the "right wing",
parts of dorsal vertebrae 5 and 6,
an indeterminate dorsal vertebral process,
part of a sacral or late dorsal vertebra,
the distal end of a second scapula,
a partial ilium,
and
two unidentified elements.

These jackets are too small to contain complete vertebrae or even very substantial partial vertebral material, and certainly no complete appendicular elements. However, the chance remains that some diagnostic material is contained, and the jackets should be prepped as circumstances allow.

### Are Janensch's two specimens the same taxon?

![Cervical vertebrae referred to _Giraffatitan brancai_](figures/export/si-and-sii-cervical-comparison.jpeg)

> Cervical vertebrae referred by Janensch (1950) to _Giraffatitan brancai_ ("_Brachiosaurus_" _brancai_ of his usage). Left block: lectoype MB.R.2180 ("SI"); right block: paralectotype MB.R.2181 ("SII"). Within each block: left column: posterior view, middle column: lateral, right column: anterior. Rows, from top to bottom: C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8. All illustrations taken from Janensch (1950:figures 14-46). Cervicals 6, 7 and 8 of MB.R.2181 ("SII") were illustrated in left lateral view, and are here reversed for consistency with the right lateral views of the other vertebrae. Cervicals 3-7 represent the only overlapping material between the two specimens.

XXX SI and SII cervicals are not actually that similar




## Phylogenetic analysis

XXX To follow

In consultation with Phil Mannion, I rescored the followin charcters in the matrix:

* C118. Postaxial cervical centra, anterior half of ventral surfaces are: flat or mildly convex mediolaterally (0); concave mediolaterally (1) (Upchurch, 1998; Mannion et al., 2013). Rescored from 0 to 1 for _Giraffatitan_ (Taxon 32).



## Systematic Palaeontology

**Locality:** M 23 quarry, "2½ miles west of north of Tendaguru Hill" (Migeod 1931a:87), which is itself 50 miles north-west from Lindi, Tanzania.

**Horizon:** "between two marine beds, the upper known as the _Trigonia smeei_ zone, the lower about a hundred feet below it as the _Nerinea_ zone. In altitude M 23 was considerably nearer the upper marine bed than the lower" (Migeod 1931a:87).
